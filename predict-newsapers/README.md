# Predict Newspapers

## Project Goals

We are given a newspaper article without knowing which newspaper it comes from.

We must predict which newspaper a newspaper article is from - this is a classification problem.  

## The Dataset

The [climate-news-db](https://www.climate-news-db.com/) is a dataset of newspapers on climate change, created & maintained by [Data Science South](https://www.datasciencesouth.com/).

An old version of the climate-news-db database is in this repo in `data.zip` - you should unzip this into a folder called `data`:

```shell-session
$ unzip data.zip
```
